# Exercise: Word Count Per Record
## Write a new Kafka application WordCountPerLineApp (using Kafka Producer and Consumer APIs) that does the following:

Consumes records from a topic, e.g. input

Counts words (in the value of a record)

Produces records with the unique words and their occurences (counts)

A record key -> hello hello world gives a record with the following value hello -> 2, world -> 1 (and the same key as in the input record)
